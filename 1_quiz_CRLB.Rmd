Problem 1:

Suppose $X_1,...,X_n \overset{iid}{\sim} Normal(\mu, \theta)$, where $\mu$ in known and $\theta$ is unknown.

- $f(x_i|\mu,\theta)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\theta}}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2\theta}(x_i-\mu)^2 \right\}$

(a) What is $\ell(\theta|x)$?

(b) What is $\frac{d}{d\theta}\ell(\theta|x)$?

\vspace{3cm}

(c) What is $\frac{d^2}{d\theta^2}\ell(\theta|x)$?

(d) What is the (expected) Fisher information $I(\theta_0)$?

(e) We have shown previously that the sample variance $S^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta$. We also have shown that $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}\sim \chi^2_{n-1}$. Using these two pieces of information, determine whether $S^2$ attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound.

(f) What does your result in (e) mean in terms of efficiency of the estimator $S^2$?
